This is a copy of the hid_composite example from TinyUSB (https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/tree/master/examples/device/hid_composite)
showing how to build with TinyUSB when using the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. 

The Pico is recognized as a HID, and a keyboard and mouse queue was added. A demo "Hello World!" are typed from the device after connecting via USB.
